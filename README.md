# Food Recalls at the US Food and Drug Administration
==============================

Mod3 Project
==============================

This project examines food recalls in the United States between January 20, 2015 and January 19, 2019. The goal of the project is to test several hypotheses with the purpose of informing congressional oversight committees, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other interested parties. The analysis is designed to address the following questions:

1. Has the proportion of recalls classified as Class I declined since President Trump took office?
2. Has the proportion of recall initiated by the FDA declined since President Trump took office?
3. Did the proportion of voluntary recalls from won by President Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election decline after the election?
4. Did the proportion of Class I recalls from states won by President Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election decline after the election?

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?

Data for the project comes from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [Food Recall Enforcement Reports](https://open.fda.gov/downloads/) which includes information about the classification of the recall and the type of recall(i.e., voluntary or mandatory). Food recalls are classified into one of three classes. The FDA defines these classes as follows:

1. Class I recall: a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
2. Class II recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.
3. Class III recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.

Recalls in the data set fall into three categories:
  1. Voluntary: Firm Initiated- These recalls are voluntarily initiated by the recalling firm. Voluntary recalls make up  approximately 97% of all recalls in the United States. 
  2. FDA requested- These recalls are initiated by a request from the FDA. Requested recalls are the rarest type of recall.
  3. FDA Mandated- These recalls are mandated by the FDA. Mandated requests make up approximately 3% of recalls in the United States. 

# Process
What is the population?


# Methodology

Z-tests for the differences between two proportions are used to test the sets of hypotheses listed below. The hypothesis tests are one-tailed (upper-tail) tests designed to evaluate whether the proportion being tested declines after President Trump's inauguration. In addition to z-tests, trends from 2012 to 2019 are anlyzed. The trend analyses evaluate whether the z-test results reflect a true change relative to the beginning of the Trump Administration or the continuation of a trend beginning prior to President Trump's inauguration. 


# Findings

* Has the proportion of recalls classified as Class I declined since President Trump took office?


* Has the proportion of recall initiated by the FDA declined since President Trump took office?


* Did the proportion of voluntary recalls from won by President Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election decline after the election?
Our analysis found a 

* Did the proportion of Class I recalls from states won by President Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election decline after the election?

Our analysis did not find evidence of a difference in the proportion of Class I recalls in states won by President Trump from the two years before the President's inauguration to the two years following the inauguration.
